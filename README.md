# Running the Example App

You can just open index.html to run the app. However, you'll need to run `gulp` to build the app (this will also watch for changes - just like the homework).

There are several different components: GrowingList, LikeButton, and more. The app is only meant to render one at a time; you can change which one from `init.js`.
